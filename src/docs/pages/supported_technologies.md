# Supported technologies

Tracker currently only supports React projects written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

For the purpose of homebrew detection, Tracker only supports lowercase JSX elements like `<div/>`,
as opposed to CSS-in-JS wrappers typically used as `styled.div`. See the report intro
for more information about [homebrew components.](https://observablehq.com/@smoogly/design-system-metrics#cell-301)


## Other frameworks 

The frameworks vary greatly in ways they define a component, usage of a component, and dependencies between components.
It makes it hard to support other popular frameworks out of the box.

if you want to see support for a particular technology.
